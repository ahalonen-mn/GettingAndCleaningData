# GettingAndCleaningData

## Purpose
### This project cleans data that was collected in a smarphone study. In the study, 30 participants performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

## This code does the following:
### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
